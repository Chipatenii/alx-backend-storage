# 0x02-redis_basic

## Description
This repository contains projects and tasks focused on using Redis for basic operations and as a simple cache. Redis is a powerful in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. Through this project, you'll learn the fundamental operations of Redis and how to implement it as a caching solution.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to use Redis for basic operations
- Understand how to use Redis as a simple cache

## Requirements
- **General:**
  - All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
  - All files should end with a new line
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
  - All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
  - All classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
  - All functions and methods should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
  - Documentation should be a meaningful sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length of it will be verified.
  - All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
