# 0x01-python_async_function

Welcome to the `0x01-python_async_function` repository! This project demonstrates the basics of asynchronous programming in Python using `async` and `await` syntax, the `asyncio` module, and the `random` module. Below you'll find an overview of the concepts covered and how to run the examples in this repository.

## Async and Await Syntax

Asynchronous programming allows you to write code that performs non-blocking operations. In Python, this is done using the `async` and `await` keywords:

- **`async`**: Defines a coroutine, which is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed.
- **`await`**: Pauses the coroutine until the awaited task is completed.

Example:
```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulates an I/O operation
    print("Data fetched!")
```

## Executing an Async Program with asyncio

To execute an async program, use the `asyncio.run()` function, which serves as the entry point for running your async code.

Example:
```python
async def main():
    await fetch_data()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Running Concurrent Coroutines

`asyncio` allows you to run multiple coroutines concurrently. This is useful when you have multiple tasks that can be performed simultaneously, such as fetching data from multiple sources.

Example:
```python
async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Data fetched!")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(fetch_data(), fetch_data(), fetch_data())

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Creating asyncio Tasks

`asyncio` provides a way to create tasks, which are objects that represent coroutines that can be run concurrently. Tasks can be created using `asyncio.create_task()`.

Example:
```python
async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Data fetched!")

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data())
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_data())

    await task1
    await task2

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Using the Random Module

The `random` module is used to generate pseudo-random numbers. This can be useful in async programming when you want to introduce random delays or simulate unpredictable events.

Example:
```python
import asyncio
import random

async def fetch_data():
    delay = random.uniform(0, 2)
    print(f"Fetching data with delay of {delay:.2f} seconds...")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print("Data fetched!")

asyncio.run(fetch_data())
```

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chipatenii/0x01-python_async_function.git
   cd 0x01-python_async_function
   ```

2. Run the Python scripts:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed to fully utilize `asyncio`.
