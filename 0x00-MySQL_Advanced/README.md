# 0x00-MySQL_Advanced

Welcome to the `0x00-MySQL_Advanced` repository! This project explores advanced MySQL concepts, including table creation with constraints, query optimization through indexes, and the implementation of stored procedures, functions, views, and triggers.

## Creating Tables with Constraints

Constraints in MySQL are rules that enforce limits on the data in a table to ensure data integrity. Common constraints include:

- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each row.
- **FOREIGN KEY**: Ensures the referential integrity between two tables.
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures that all values in a column are unique.
- **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
- **CHECK**: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

## Optimizing Queries by Adding Indexes

Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of rows from a table. Adding indexes can significantly improve the performance of queries, especially on large datasets.

Example:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);
```

## Stored Procedures and Functions

Stored procedures and functions are reusable SQL code blocks that can be executed with specific parameters. 

- **Stored Procedure**: A set of SQL statements that perform a specific task.
- **Function**: Similar to a procedure but returns a value.

Example - Stored Procedure:
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails(IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

Example - Function:
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE FUNCTION CalculateBonus(salary DECIMAL(10,2)) RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
BEGIN
    RETURN salary * 0.10;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

## Implementing Views

Views are virtual tables that represent the result of a stored query. They can be used to simplify complex queries, enhance security, and manage access to data.

Example:
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_department AS
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

## Implementing Triggers

Triggers are automated actions that occur in response to certain events on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SET NEW.name = UPPER(NEW.name);
END;
```

## How to Use the Scripts

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chipatenii/0x00-MySQL_Advanced.git
   cd 0x00-MySQL_Advanced
   ```

2. Open the MySQL command line or a MySQL client.

3. Run the scripts:
   ```sql
   SOURCE script_name.sql;
   ```

4. Ensure you have the necessary privileges to create tables, procedures, views, and triggers.
