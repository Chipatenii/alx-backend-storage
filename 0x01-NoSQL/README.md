## Description
This repository contains projects and tasks aimed at understanding NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB. The focus is on learning the fundamentals of NoSQL, including the differences between SQL and NoSQL, the concept of ACID, document storage, various types of NoSQL databases, and the benefits they offer. Additionally, the repository covers practical aspects such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting information from a NoSQL database using MongoDB.

- Learn the differences between SQL and NoSQL
- Understand what ACID is
- Learn what document storage is
- Explore different types of NoSQL databases
- Understand the benefits of using a NoSQL database
- Learn how to query information from a NoSQL database
- Learn how to insert, update, and delete information from a NoSQL database
- Get hands-on experience with MongoDB

## Requirements

  - All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MongoDB (version 4.2)
  - All files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all your files should be a comment: `// my comment`
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
  - The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

- **Python Scripts:**

  - The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
  - All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
  - All functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
  - Your code should not be executed when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
